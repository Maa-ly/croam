Intent-Driven Agentic Payments on Cronos (Main Track Submission)

1. Project Idea Overview
AutoPay Buddy is an intent-driven, agentic on-chain payments application built on Cronos EVM using x402 programmatic payment flows. The project enables users to express high-level financial intentions—such as paying rent safely, sending allowances when affordable, or automating subscriptions—without manually signing transactions each time.

Instead of relying on rigid schedules, AutoPay Buddy introduces a lightweight AI-driven execution agent that evaluates user-defined constraints before triggering payments. These constraints include balance thresholds, safety buffers, timing windows, and priority rules. The agent decides when and whether a payment should be executed, and once approved, settles the transaction using x402-compatible flows on Cronos.

By combining human-readable intent, adaptive agent logic, and x402-native settlement, AutoPay Buddy demonstrates how everyday financial behaviors can be transformed into intelligent, autonomous on-chain workflows. The project positions x402 as a practical foundation for consumer-facing agentic payments within the Cronos ecosystem.

2. Problem Statement
Most on-chain payment experiences are either fully manual—requiring repeated user signatures—or overly rigid, executing transactions regardless of a user’s financial context. This makes recurring payments, subscriptions, and allowances risky or inconvenient in Web3.

Users want automation that behaves more like a financial assistant than a timer: payments that respect affordability, adapt to changing balances, and explain why actions were taken or delayed. Current solutions rarely combine this adaptive behavior with secure, programmatic on-chain settlement.

3. Solution
AutoPay Buddy solves this by introducing an agentic payment layer on top of Cronos x402. Users define intent and constraints once, and the agent continuously evaluates execution conditions. Payments are only triggered when rules are satisfied, and settlement occurs through x402 flows without repeated user approvals.

This creates a safer, more human-centric automation model while preserving transparency, auditability, and user control.

4. MVP Scope
The MVP focuses on demonstrating a clear end-to-end agentic payment flow using x402 on Cronos EVM. The scope is intentionally minimal to highlight core functionality.

4.1 Core MVP Features
- Intent Creation UI:
 Users define a payment intent including recipient, amount, frequency, and safety buffer.

- Agentic Decision Layer:
 A lightweight agent evaluates wallet balance and user-defined constraints before execution.

- Conditional Execution:
 Payments are delayed or skipped if constraints (e.g., minimum balance buffer) are violated.

- x402 Settlement:
 Approved payments are executed using x402-compatible programmatic payment flows on Cronos.

- Transparency & Explainability:
 The UI displays the agent’s decision state (Ready, Delayed, Executed) and reasoning.

4.2 MVP Demo Flow
1. User creates a payment intent:
  Example: “Pay 100 USDC rent monthly, but keep at least 300 USDC balance.”

2. Agent monitors wallet state:
  The agent checks balance and upcoming execution window.

3. Decision phase:
  If balance minus payment is below the safety buffer, execution is delayed.

4. Execution:
  Once conditions are satisfied, the agent triggers an x402 settlement on Cronos EVM.

5. On-chain confirmation:
  Transaction is visible on Cronos testnet or mainnet.

5. Technical Components (High-Level)
- Frontend:
 Simple web UI for intent creation and agent status visualization.

- Agent Service:
 Off-chain agent logic that evaluates conditions and triggers x402 flows.

- Smart Contracts:
 Contracts deployed on Cronos EVM to store payment intents and enforce execution rules.

- x402 Facilitator SDK:
 Used for programmatic settlement and payment execution.

6. Main Track Alignment
AutoPay Buddy fits squarely within the Main Track by showcasing:

- Agent-triggered on-chain actions
- Practical, consumer-facing x402 use cases
- Adaptive decision-making rather than fixed automation
- Clear intent → agent → settlement flow

The MVP prioritizes clarity, usability, and real-world relevance while demonstrating the power of agentic payments on Cronos.
